# Finder of forumulas

Have you ever wanted to just search a fourmla without scroling and scrolingo at wikipedia to find it?\\
Don't say more, here is an easy searcher for formulas on wikipedia, you just need to type the name of the formula like in google and, like magic, it will apear.\\
I aslo added the LaTeX code that generate the formula to copy and paste it where you need it. And there is more, if the first example that appears isn't what you need, you are at one click away to see the next result insted of scroling.
